For IAP in January 2015, I participated in <a href="http://maslab.mit.edu/2015/" target="_blank">Mobile Autonomous Systems Lab</a> with some friends. Our task was to move red and green wood blocks to various zones within an enclosure. We had a few weeks to build a robot to sense, pick up, sort, then deposit the blocks.

My role was to design and fabricate much of the frame. For example, I remember CADing the swivel sorter on top, the gripper at the end of our four-bar linkage arm, as well as many of the body plates and interfaces. It was enormously helpful to have access to 3D printers and laser cutters, and so satisfying when things worked on the first try!

With plenty of mishaps and all-nighters, we took fourth place overall in the competition and were named "most likely to return as instructors."
