We built an R/C aircraft to carry a payload of raw eggs for a lab assignment in <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/aeronautics-and-astronautics/16-01-unified-engineering-i-ii-iii-iv-fall-2005-spring-2006/" target="_blank">Unified Engineering</a>.

The most challenging aspects of the design challenge were optimizing within given <a href="/img/airplane/Lab4-spec.pdf" target="_blank">constraints</a>, airfoil fabrication, and flying the darn thing. Thanks Dr. Drela for XFOIL and the nifty CNC foam cutter! And thanks AeroAstro for the flight simulator practice, even though we still managed to crash into the gym ceiling.

Other Unified labs were fun as well, for example chasing high-altitude weather balloons and building bottle rockets. Our MATLAB simulations kept getting better, as did our understanding of signals, structures, fluids, and thermodynamics. Here's an example lab <a href="/img/airplane/rocket-report.pdf" target="_blank">report</a>.
