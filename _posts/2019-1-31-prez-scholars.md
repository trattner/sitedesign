After participating in the 2014 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Scholars_Program" target="_blank">U.S. Presidential Scholars Program</a>, I returned the following three years as an advisor to help out. In my final year, <a href="https://blog.ed.gov/2017/07/the-ability-to-inspire/" target="_blank">I served as one of two executive advisors</a>. We coordinated logistics for the entire program, including training younger advisors and managing large-scale events at venues like the White House and the Kennedy Center.

We implemented a number of operational improvements during my time as exec, and I was later asked along with my co-exec to join the <a href="https://www.presidentialscholars.org/" target="_blank">alumni association</a> board of directors. I served on the board for a year and have been proud to see future generations of advisors carrying the torch forward.
