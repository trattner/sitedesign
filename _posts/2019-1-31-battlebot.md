Sophomore year of high school, I took a robotics class that participated in <a href="http://www.wi-robotics.org/" target="_blank">BotsIQ Wisconsin</a>, a scholastic 15lb battlebot competition. Our team was called the Intergalactic Dragon Force.

We mounted some nasty mill blades on a shaft and designed a polycarbonate body with exposed rear wheels to climb walls backwards in case we got cornered. My main contributions were CAD and fabrication related. I remember printing lots of technical drawings, writing G-code for the CNC mill, being afraid of the power sander debris, shaping and cutting various metal shafts with a brake and Dremel, and frantically drilling random holes in our body plates (physically and virtually) to make weight.

Our documentation binder scored one point short of perfect, tying the all-time record and bringing us a 1st place state champion award. Everything in the competition went downhill from there. A combination of poorly soldered speed controller connections, faulty receivers, and dubious design decisions culminated in a couple one-sided match-ups.

The whole experience was tremendously helpful in launching my engineering career. By the end of the class, I could create a decent CAD model in a just a few minutes on the final exam.

I brought my knowledge to future jobs and robotics teams in Portland, Oregon and elsewhere.
