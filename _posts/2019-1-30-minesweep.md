At MIT, I taught as a student lab assistant for <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-01sc-introduction-to-electrical-engineering-and-computer-science-i-spring-2011/" target="_blank">Intro to EECS (6.01)</a> during fall 2015, and I took <a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/sp16/" target="_blank">Software Construction (6.005)</a> in the spring of 2016. The latter class was a truly awesome learning experience that hammered home spec-driven and test-driven development in Java.

A fun <a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/sp16/psets/ps4/" target="_blank">problem set</a> had us implement a <a href="https://github.com/trattner/6.005/tree/master/minesweeper" target="_blank">multiplayer minesweeper server</a>. For the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/sp16/projects/abcplayer/" target="_blank">final project</a>, we worked in teams to create an <a href="https://github.com/trattner/6.005/tree/master/music-player" target="_blank">abc music player</a>.

(It was also the class in which I discovered a cup of black tea has enough caffeine to complete my <a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/sp16/quizzes/archive/quiz1.pdf" target="_blank">dozen-page quiz</a> in less than half of the given hour, winning the race with a near-perfect score ahead of a couple hundred other beavers. Yay Clover!)

I started the fall 2016 semester with graduate-level <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/fa17/6.867/index.html" target="_blank">Machine Learning (6.867)</a>. After the <a href="/img/papers/homework1.pdf" target="_blank">first assignment</a> was <a href="/img/papers/6-867-homework.pdf" target="_blank">completed</a> (with <a href="/img/papers/Reviews-hw1.pdf" target="_blank">solid reviews</a> and a perfect score), I dropped the class in favor of <a href="http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.854/current/" target="_blank">Advanced Algorithms (6.854)</a> and <a href="http://www-math.mit.edu/~dav/821.html" target="_blank">Math Project Lab (18.821)</a>.
