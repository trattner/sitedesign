Upon arriving at MIT in 2014, I was surprised to find a sad, dying chess club with zero to three weekly attendees. After trying unsuccessfully to work with unresponsive leadership for a year and a half, I launched a grassroots campaign to revive the chess community starting spring semester 2016.

In the beginning, this mostly consisted of me sitting in the student center on Saturday mornings reading and playing chess with myself. But I was used to this after four years of high school. With some persistence, folks eventually started to join in, and we rebranded the club later that semester with a new officer corps.

Once we were official, there was still a lot of work to do. I created an improved <a href="http://chess.mit.edu/" target="_blank">website</a> and hunted down the musical theater guild for the chess@ email handle. The biggest issue was money: the old chess club handed us thousands of dollars in debt. How does that even happen!?

We righted the ship over time: acquiring corporate sponsors, building a strong digital presence and membership base, collaborating with local clubs and schools, opening events to the greater Boston community, and competing in national tournaments. As of 2018, I'm proud to say that the organization has a solid foundation, and it keeps getting better every year.
