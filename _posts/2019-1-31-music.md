The final project for <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/music-and-theater-arts/21m-301-harmony-and-counterpoint-i-spring-2005/" target="_blank">Harmony and Counterpoint I (21M.301)</a> is to compose a short string quartet in rounded binary form.

In fall 2015, some of Dr. Casinghino's PhD students from Boston University sight-read my piece. Listen to "100 Strings" <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5Tfw9EUMk1wWThVa2ZBSkhidHM/view" target="_blank">here</a>.

And another little <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5Tfw9EUMk1wTUs4NGdpWFk4WHM" target="_blank">jingle</a> I have long forgotten about...it's a bit jarring with computer-generated audio.
