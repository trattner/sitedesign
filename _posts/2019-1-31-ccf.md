![Yay Bubbles][bubbles]

I had an amazing opportunity to work with the Dryden Drop Tower Lab at Portland State University in the summer of 2013. It started with the inaugural <a href="https://www.pdx.edu/cecs/psu-high-school-innovation-challenge" target="_blank">PSU High School Innovation Challenge</a>. One of our mentors gave a splendid tour of the engineering school to our team.

We were introduced to a researcher leading development on <a href="https://www.se-fit.com/" target="_blank">SE-FIT</a>, a computational fluid dynamics interface. Finding the simulations beautiful and the math comprehensible, I reached out after the tour. Serendipitously, I ended up on the team with multiple roles.

Each day, I would bike downtown to do SE-FIT work from 9a-3p. Then from 3-11p, I would take a shift co-commanding the Capillary Channel Flow experiment on the International Space Station through NASA uplink channels. A couple times I helped cover the 11p-7a shift for our German colleagues at ZARM. Our data runs consisted entirely of making, measuring, and recording bubbles under various conditions.

By the end of the summer, I ended up contributing a few hundred lines of code to SE-FIT as well as some documentation help. The most substantial value-add was a Lagrange interpolation implementation that sped a parametric sweep function threefold. Most of my morning time was spent learning programming basics, and I'm exceedingly grateful to everyone who patiently helped me along the way. I'm told SE-FIT has been used by NASA and various companies, for example Xerox with inkjet applications.

I recall editing a paragraph or two for the paper and scripting some macros in Excel to analyze a few million data entries. But my largest contribution was definitely in the data collection and regime mapping process. Overall, this was an extraordinarily fun, eye-opening experience!
