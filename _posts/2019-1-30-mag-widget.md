I have made plenty of amusing mistakes during technical interviews. For example, a quantitative trader once asked how many handshakes occur among a dozen people who all meet each other and shake hands. I quickly responded, "twelve factorial," which was met by a friendly pause, "how long do you estimate that would take?"

The most cringeworthy interview I've had consisted of a single task: to recreate this <a href="https://www.google.com/logos/2011/worldsfair.html" target="_blank">Google Doodle effect</a>. I wasn't prepared at all, and I utterly failed to make any sort of progress until our hour expired.

I promptly went to an empty classroom and set aside my homework, spending the next three hours learning a bit of JavaScript to produce some working <a href="https://github.com/trattner/scale" target="_blank">code</a>, now proudly on <a href="https://trattner.github.io/scale" target="_blank">display</a>.
