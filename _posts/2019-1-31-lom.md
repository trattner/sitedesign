<a href="https://lean0n.me" target="_blank">Lean On Me</a> is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that uses technology to facilitate challenging conversations and improve student mental health on college campuses. The organization makes it quick and easy to receive quality support from an anonymous peer via text message.

I created Lean On Me in the fall of 2015 with the help of many others. We all felt an effective peer-based alternative to existing mental health resources would meet a lot of needs. The concept grew surprisingly quickly from a vague idea into a prize-winning hackathon project and well-known student group. We started getting press coverage and inbound interest from student leaders around the globe. Our little project ended up going through an accelerator to become a national entity, less than a year after inception.

My biggest contributions all occurred between September 2015 and June 2016, when I led the team (rather frantically while taking 5 classes) in breaking lots of new ground and growing the organization towards sustainability. For example: designing the Lean On Me brand, recruiting team members and advisors, creating training programs and marketing campaigns, writing legal policies, fundraising, etc.

In early July 2016, I transitioned to an advisor role. Upon incorporation, I joined the board of directors. Like all great opportunities, Lean On Me has altered the course of my life and shaped me in many ways. It's been tremendously heartwarming to see the impact and momentum continue.
